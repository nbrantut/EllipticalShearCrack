* EllipticalShearCrack

This code is an implementation (right now only in Matlab) of the closed-form solution for acceleration and stresses around a dynamically expanding elliptical shear crack, published as:

 ``The dynamic field of a growing plane elliptical shear crack'', by Paul G. Richard, /Int. J. Solids Structures, 9/, pp. 843-861, 1973.

The original paper contained some difficult typos.

WARNING: At the moment the code still has major bugs, and it is not sure whether more typos exist in the text or if it is an implementation issue.
